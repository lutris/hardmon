Hardware monitoring tool for Linux
==================================

hardmon is a CLI tool to gather hardware information in real time. It is primarely intended 
to be used to benchmark a machine while running games or other performance intensive tasks.

This is currently a prototype, Nvidia GPUs are not supported.

Collected metrics are:
- GPU clocks
- GPU voltage
- GPU load
- GPU power consumption
- GPU temperature
- VRAM usage
- CPU clocks
- CPU temperature
- CPU load
- CPU power consumption
- RAM usage

Output is returned in JSON Lines format (each line is a valid JSON object) to stdout.
